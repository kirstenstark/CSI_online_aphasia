# People with aphasia show stable Cumulative Semantic Interference (CSI) when tested repeatedly in a web-based paradigm: A perspective for longitudinal assessment

Retrieving words quickly and correctly is an important language competence. Semantic contexts, such as prior naming of categorically related objects, can induce conceptual priming but also lexical-semantic interference, the latter likely due to enhanced competition during lexical selection. In the continuous naming (CN) paradigm, such semantic interference is evident in a linear increase in naming latency with each additional member of a category, embedded in a seemingly random sequence of pictures, being named (cumulative semantic interference/CSI effect). Extensively studied in neurotypical participants, CSI studies in people with aphasia (PWA) are rare–even though language network lesions regularly and persistently impair word retrieval. In the present study, 20 PWA with lesions in the extended left hemispheric language network and 20 matched controls underwent a CN paradigm, naming photographs of closely related objects from 24 categories (e.g., birds) with 5 members each. The experiment was conducted web-based (Stark et al., 2022) on three days (day 1, 2, and 8). The main results are: (i) Mild-moderate aphasia does not preclude web-based testing. (ii) The CSI effect (~23ms per ordinal position) did not differ significantly between groups and was stable across days. (iii) Overall response times decreased between day 1 and day 2 but remained stable on day 8. (iv) In PWA, increased error-rates paralleled the latency-based CSI effect. (v) Exploratory structural MRI analyses suggest that lesions in a cluster comprising frontal and parietal language areas correlate with larger CSI effects. We conclude that browser-based assessment is feasible in PWA and yields a stable CSI effect over repetitive testing. Thus, adaptive changes and treatment effects in PWA can be tracked web-based, which is of clinical relevance for aphasia diagnostics and therapy. The exploratory lesion analysis provides a first step towards defining the neuronal underpinnings of semantic context effects in PWA.


The paradigm was identical to our previous browser-based experiment in young, healthy participants (doi: 10.3758/s13428-021-01768-2). The study was coded in SoSciSurvey (Leiner, 2019) and run in participants’ web browser, and analyses were performed in R.
